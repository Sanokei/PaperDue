<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The project is a server I personally wanted to play on. A factions server where the claims were over claimable with force via raids. This simple implementation will make the gamemode more engaging and fun. A fresh experience for minecraft faction players. The project began as an idea on March 25th 2021. Slowly through the beginning months the project began to take shape and flourish.


### Built With

* [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You need to compile the files into a jar to be able to run it on your own server.

(Keep in mind, you are not allowed to create a server with the plugin. There is no license for a reason. But if you and you friends want to play on a private server, I would not know about it *wink wink*)
